The purpose of this web page is to display all the information Horiseon has to offer regarding online marketing and ways one can improve its bussiness and attract more clients. The web page consists of a header with a navigation bar with links that take you to the different topics on the page. Then it is divided in a main section with all these topics and a sidebar with key factors that help measure the effectiveness of a project or the business overall.

The Webpage is organized in a fashion that is appaeling to the users and its well organized so they can find the information quickly and intuitively. Also it has styles build with Css to reflect the Horiseon brand colors and also to make a it a formal and beautiful looking page. Finally it is designed to work well for screens with resolutions of 768 px (tablets) or higher ones. 

In order for these characteristics and to succesfuly code this webpage from the base that was provided, the following steps were taken:

First of all correct all the duplicated code so the index and style sheets would be more readable. After that, I added all the main classes needed to add styles that are missing from the final product. After that, I proceeded to work on the different sections of the webpage to match the desired final product image. 

First of all sections I worked with the header, making sure the navigation bar elements would be separated from the Horiseon brand name, then I made sure the main image of the header would not overlap with the navigation or the next section. 

After the header section was finished, the nest section that was corrected was the 'main content blocks' section where you can find the main topics and the essential information of the webpage. I worked on correcting that look of it, so everything could fit correctly in the blocks and not overlap. Also made sure that I would look well even if the base resolution on the user screen is higher. I adjusted the text and image size so it would fit correctly and look appaeling. Finally, I made sure the correct margin where in place so each block would be seperated between them and the other sections.

After the main content section was finished I continued to work on the sidebar. There I corrected appaerance and size so all the info and icons would fit correctly, be centered and looked appaeling to the eye. Finally in this section I made sure that the sidebar would be more or less the same height of the main content section.

After all sections were finished I made final changes to correct any information that was incorrect in the code, like changing the title of the website. In general add the final touches so the webpage would match the desired final product. Finally I just made sure that all links worked correctly and that the url is working in the web browser.
